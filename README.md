‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

The bot uses a ticket_config.json file for its settings. You can easily add new ticket types and roles directly in the Python code.
Adding New Ticket Categories

    Locate the @app_commands.choices decorator for the typ_ticketu argument within the /ustaw_kategorie command definition.

    Add a new app_commands.Choice line following the existing pattern.

@app_commands.choices(typ_ticketu=[
    app_commands.Choice(name="AIAD", value="aiad"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Skarga", value="skarga"),
    # ... other choices ...
    app_commands.Choice(name="SWAT", value="swat"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Zamkniƒôte", value="zamkniete"),
    # Add your new category choice here:
    app_commands.Choice(name="New Example Category", value="new_example_category")
])

    Remember to also configure the ticket_role_mapping in your ticket_config.json if this new category requires specific staff roles.

    Use the /ustaw_kategorie command to link this new type (new_example_category) to a Discord category ID.

Adding New Staff Roles

    Locate the @app_commands.choices decorator for the nazwa_roli argument within the /ustaw_role command definition.

    Add a new app_commands.Choice line. The value should be a unique internal identifier for this staff group.

@app_commands.choices(nazwa_roli=[
    app_commands.Choice(name="AIAD", value="aiad_staff"), # Example: value = 'aiad_staff'
    app_commands.Choice(name="High Command", value="high_command"),
    app_commands.Choice(name="Command Staff", value="command_staff"),
    # Add your new role choice here:
    app_commands.Choice(name="New Staff Group", value="new_staff_group")
])

    Use the /ustaw_role command to link this internal name (new_staff_group) to a Discord role ID.

    Update the ticket_role_mapping in your ticket_config.json to assign this new staff group (new_staff_group) to the relevant ticket types.

üåç Language Note

All internal logging messages (INFO, Debug, Errors) printed to the console are currently in Polish. The bot was initially developed for a Polish-speaking community. Translation might be needed for broader use.
