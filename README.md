## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

The bot uses a `ticket_config.json` file for its settings. You can easily add new ticket types and roles directly in the Python code.

### Adding New Ticket Categories

1.  Locate the `@app_commands.choices` decorator for the `typ_ticketu` argument within the `/set_category` command definition.
2.  Add a new `app_commands.Choice` line following the existing pattern.

    ```python
    @app_commands.choices(typ_ticketu=[
        app_commands.Choice(name="AIAD", value="aiad"),
        app_commands.Choice(name="Skarga", value="skarga"),
        # ... other choices ...
        app_commands.Choice(name="SWAT", value="swat"),
        app_commands.Choice(name="Zamkniƒôte", value="zamkniete"),
        # Add your new category choice here:
        app_commands.Choice(name="New Example Category", value="new_example_category")
    ])
    ```
3.  Remember to also configure the `ticket_role_mapping` in your `ticket_config.json` if this new category requires specific staff roles.
4.  Use the `/set_category` command to link this new type (`new_example_category`) to a Discord category ID.

### Adding New Staff Roles

1.  Locate the `@app_commands.choices` decorator for the `nazwa_roli` argument within the `/set_role` command definition.
2.  Add a new `app_commands.Choice` line. The `value` should be a unique internal identifier for this staff group.

    ```python
    @app_commands.choices(nazwa_roli=[
        app_commands.Choice(name="High Command", value="high_command"),
        app_commands.Choice(name="Command Staff", value="command_staff"),
        # Add your new role choice here:
        app_commands.Choice(name="New Staff Group", value="new_staff_group")
    ])
    ```
3.  Use the `/set_role` command to link this internal name (`new_staff_group`) to a Discord role ID.
4.  Update the `ticket_role_mapping` in your `ticket_config.json` to assign this new staff group (`new_staff_group`) to the relevant ticket types.

## üåç Language Note

All internal logging messages (INFO, Debug, Errors) printed to the console are currently in Polish. The bot was initially developed for a Polish-speaking community. Translation might be needed for broader use.
